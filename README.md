Hello, World!
=============

<p align='center'>🇪🇸 ¡Hola!　🇬🇧 Hello!　🇫🇷 Salut!　🇯🇵 こんにちは！</p>

I'm a passionate computer nerd who enjoys going one layer too deep. I'm
particularly interested in the study and design of operating systems, computer
languages, hardware architecture and networks.

I tend to keep my projects private, advance chaotically and close them without
hesitation. When I manage to break that nasty habit, the fruits of my labor
will appear below, pinky promise!
